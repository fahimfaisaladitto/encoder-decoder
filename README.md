# Technologies Used
• HTML5: For the fundamental structure and content of the application.

• CSS3: For custom styling, animations, and the implementation of the glassmorphism effect using CSS variables for theming.

• Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for rapid layout and component styling.

• JavaScript (ES6): Powers all the application's logic, including dark mode functionality, conversion algorithms, and dynamic UI updates.

# Project Structure
<h4 align="left">The project is organized into three separate files for better maintainability and separation of concerns:</h4>

• index.html: This file contains the core HTML structure and content of the web application. It links to the external CSS and JavaScript files.

• style.css: This file holds all the custom CSS, including theme variables for light/dark modes, animations, and specific component styles that complement Tailwind CSS.

• script.js: This file contains all the application logic, including dark mode toggling, handling user input, performing the encoding/decoding operations, and dynamically updating the DOM.

# Setup and Installation
<h4 align="left">Since this project uses basic web technologies with no complex build steps (other than CDN links for frameworks), the setup is straightforward.</h4>

• Clone or Download: Get a copy of all three files (index.html, style.css, and script.js).

• Keep Files Together: Ensure that all three files are located in the same folder or directory.

• Open in Browser: Right-click the index.html file and choose "Open with" your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

<h4 align="left">That's it! The application will be running locally on your machine.</h4>
